# Language Learning for Grammar Feedback

An intelligent, real-time grammar correction system designed to enhance writing proficiency by providing accurate and context-aware feedback on grammatical errors. This project leverages an ensemble of state-of-the-art NLP models to deliver highly reliable corrections.

## üåü Abstract

[cite_start]This project introduces an advanced grammar correction system that significantly improves writing proficiency by delivering real-time feedback on a variety of grammatical errors[cite: 1]. [cite_start]The system integrates three powerful sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models‚ÄîT5, GECToR, and Coedit‚Äîand utilizes a BERT-based classification model to validate the generated corrections[cite: 2]. [cite_start]By employing a unique ensemble strategy, the system evaluates multiple correction candidates and selects the most reliable one based on classification confidence scores[cite: 3]. [cite_start]Trained on a large and diverse dataset of incorrect and corrected sentences, our system effectively addresses issues like subject-verb agreement, verb tense errors, and preposition misuse[cite: 4]. [cite_start]The project not only demonstrates a scalable and effective NLP solution but also lays the groundwork for future enhancements, including multilingual support and domain-specific adaptations[cite: 6].

## ‚ú® Key Features

- [cite_start]**High Accuracy:** Achieves an impressive **96% accuracy** through a unique ensemble strategy[cite: 17].
- [cite_start]**Multi-Model Ensemble:** Integrates T5, GECToR, and Coedit to leverage their individual strengths for more robust and nuanced corrections[cite: 7].
- [cite_start]**Reliable Validation:** Employs a BERT-based classification model to score and validate the grammatical correctness of suggestions, ensuring high-quality feedback[cite: 9, 92].
- [cite_start]**Real-Time Feedback:** Designed to provide instantaneous corrections to help users improve their writing skills efficiently[cite: 1].
- [cite_start]**Comprehensive Error Correction:** Effectively targets a wide range of common grammatical mistakes, including subject-verb agreement, verb tense, and preposition misuse[cite: 4, 23].

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The system is built using a powerful stack of modern NLP models and libraries:

- **Sequence-to-Sequence Models:**
    - [cite_start]**T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer):** Used for generating fluent and coherent corrected sentences[cite: 32, 62].
    - [cite_start]**GECToR (Grammar Error Correction Transformer):** Specifically designed for explicit grammar error identification and correction[cite: 33, 71].
    - [cite_start]**Coedit (Collaborative Editing Transformer):** Focuses on improving sentence fluency while addressing grammatical issues[cite: 34, 81].
- **Classification Model:**
    - [cite_start]**BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers):** Functions as a classifier to validate the grammatical correctness of the outputs from the seq2seq models[cite: 35, 92].
- **Core Technologies:**
    - [cite_start]**Python:** The primary programming language used for implementation and model training[cite: 36].
    - [cite_start]**HuggingFace Transformers:** Utilized for fine-tuning and training the deep learning models[cite: 36].

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture & Methodology

Our approach is centered around an innovative ensemble strategy that combines the outputs of the three seq2seq models and uses a classifier to select the best correction.

### 1. Dataset and Preprocessing

[cite_start]The system was trained on a dataset of incorrect sentences paired with their corrected versions[cite: 46]. Preprocessing steps included:
- [cite_start]Removing duplicate and erroneous entries[cite: 47].
- [cite_start]Tokenizing sentences to be compatible with model architectures[cite: 47].
- [cite_start]Padding and truncating sentences to a maximum length of 64 tokens[cite: 58, 59, 75, 85, 96].
- [cite_start]Labeling sentences for the classification task (1 for correct, 0 for incorrect)[cite: 48].

### 2. Model Fine-Tuning

Each model was fine-tuned on the preprocessed dataset:
- [cite_start]**T5:** Fine-tuned to reformulate NLP tasks as text-to-text problems, using the prefix `"fix grammar:"` to guide the correction task[cite: 51, 53].
- [cite_start]**GECToR:** Fine-tuned specifically to identify and correct grammatical errors in a seq2seq setup[cite: 71].
- [cite_start]**Coedit:** Optimized to maintain sentence fluency while performing grammar refinements[cite: 81, 87].
- [cite_start]**BERT Classifier:** Trained to evaluate sentence correctness and assign a confidence score[cite: 92, 101].

### 3. Ensemble Strategy

To ensure the highest accuracy, we developed a unique ensemble method:
1.  [cite_start]**Generate Combinations:** An input sentence is processed through six different sequential combinations of the T5, GECToR, and Coedit models[cite: 10, 104, 108].
2.  [cite_start]**Score Outputs:** Each of the six generated corrections is passed to the fine-tuned BERT classification model, which assigns a confidence score based on its grammatical correctness[cite: 105, 110].
    ```python
    scores = [Classification(output) for output in combinations]
    ```
3.  [cite_start]**Select Best Correction:** The correction with the highest score from the BERT classifier is selected as the final output[cite: 111]. [cite_start]This dynamic selection process ensures the most reliable correction is chosen for any given sentence[cite: 115].
    ```python
    return combinations[scores.index(max(scores))]
    ```

[cite_start]This multi-faceted approach reduces bias, provides an objective evaluation of each potential correction, and leverages the collective strengths of all models to maximize performance[cite: 113, 114, 116].

## üìä Results

The ensemble strategy significantly outperformed the individual models, highlighting the power of our integrated approach.

| Model | Accuracy/F1-Score | Key Strength |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| T5 | [cite_start]85% Accuracy [cite: 13] | [cite_start]Excels in generating fluent and coherent corrections[cite: 13, 62]. |
| GECToR | [cite_start]72% Accuracy [cite: 14] | [cite_start]Effective at explicit, short-sentence grammar corrections[cite: 14, 77]. |
| Coedit | [cite_start]70% Accuracy [cite: 15] | [cite_start]Maintains sentence fluency and performs well on subtle refinements[cite: 15, 87]. |
| BERT Classifier | [cite_start]90% Accuracy / 92% F1-Score [cite: 16] | [cite_start]High accuracy in validating grammatically correct sentences[cite: 16, 99]. |
| **Final Ensemble System** | [cite_start]**96% Accuracy** [cite: 17] | [cite_start]**Optimal performance by leveraging the strengths of each model**[cite: 17]. |

[cite_start]These results affirm the effectiveness of combining multiple specialized models with a robust validation layer for complex NLP tasks[cite: 18, 118].

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

We recommend the following areas for future development to further improve the system:

- [cite_start]**Expand Training Data:** Incorporate larger and more diverse datasets to enhance the models' ability to handle complex and varied sentence structures[cite: 19].
- [cite_start]**Domain-Specific Tuning:** Fine-tune the models for specialized contexts, such as academic, technical, or business writing, to improve performance for specific use cases[cite: 20].
- [cite_start]**Add Multilingual Support:** Extend the system's capabilities to support and correct grammar in multiple languages, broadening its application and user base[cite: 21].
